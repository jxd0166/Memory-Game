## Instructions

Click each card to try and find it's matching picture in as few of turns as possible in the shortest amount of time! As you go
through the game, you will start to lose stars if it takes you to long to match the pairs. Good luck!

## Contributing

Feel free to submit any push requests for updates to tweak and enhance the game! A stored list of top winners would be nice! Will attempt to update and add that feature in the future.
